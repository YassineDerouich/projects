<p id="sub-title1">The Art of War, by Sun Tzu (book), 5th century before Christ </p>
<img id="book" src="book.png" title="The Art of War" alt="book">
<div class="textbook"><p>I think that I have only read few books in my life but this one is   particularely interesting. The Art of War, by   Sun Tzu  is a book wrote  by a  Chinese Military General, five centuries before Christ. 

In this   book, Sun Tzu is laying down principles  of the art of war. He is explaining and giving  advices in short sentences on how to beat surely your enemies. 

This book is  interesting because it is not hard to read and the  principles are really interesting. They  are really  interesting because they can be interpreted in  differents ways. The book can be philosophical and the  art of war becomes the art of goals, and many of  the advices in the book that are teaching you how to  win a war can be applied in your own life.</p></div>
<p id="sub-title2">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (movie), 2001 </p>
<img id="movie" src="movie.png" title="Harry Potter 1"  alt="movie">
<div class="textmovie"><p> Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone is my favorite movie of all time. I have watched a hundred of movies in my hole life but this movie has a special place in my heart.

Harry Potter is brightly writen : it gives to the people who watch this movie an amazing experience beyond what you could dream as a child. This movie is transporting you into a magical world, composed  of lovely and amazing characters. 

The world where the story is happening is amazing and I always wanted to live  in Hogwarts, where the story is happening. A life of magic, of dreams, where everything can happen. </p>
